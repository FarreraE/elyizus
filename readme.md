ðŸ‘‹ HELLO, Iâ€™m @FarreraE

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full-stack and working in Madrid. Iâ€™m looking to create new projects and improve my skills.

Elyizus is the first project executed by Ely Jesus Farrera. The aim is to create a gallery of projects. A portfolio that will improve as I obtain knowledge and new skills. The most relevant characteristic of Elyizus personal project is to register development and personal growth. This website is the second version, the first version's catalog is available in the project section. The first release is dated July 2021 while studying the first level of Fullstack dedicated to HTML and CSS. Check on the timeline to see how far I am from that point and what I have achieved.
